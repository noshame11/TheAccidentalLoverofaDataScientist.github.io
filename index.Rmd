I am by no means a data scientist but am simply an MS Toxicology student expanding his skill set to obtain a better grasp of the knowledge out there. As a message for future neophytes learning to master the language of R, don't despair. The tools are here for learning. Simply keep trying and practice.  

You might be wondering about the webpage title, "The Accidental Lover of a Data Scientist". To tell you the truth, I was on the fence about learning programming since it is a time-consuming endeavour for a busy Columbia student. Although R is a much-coveted skill, it was the desire to grow closer and better understand the frustrations of a distractingly cute, budding data scientist that sealed the deal for me. So the language of R in this case, is partially a love story of boy chasing girl, but awkwardly doing it, in his stumbling and accidental ways. Happy ending? All I can say, it's like me learning how to program, there's a steep learning curve.  

Although passionate about science, I believe that scientists should be well-rounded individuals that can appreciate other aspects of life. I have always admired writers, painters, and other creative artists that can inspire and easily communicate their message to the masses. 

擊鼓其鏜，踴躍用兵。  
土國城漕，我獨南行。  
從孙子仲，平陳與宋。  
不我以歸，憂心有忡。  
爰居爰處，爰喪其馬，  
于以求之，于林之下。  
死生契闊，與子成說。  
執子之手，與子偕老。  
于嗟阔兮，不我活兮。  
于嗟洵兮，不我信兮。    



君生我未生，我生君已老。  
君恨我生遲，我恨君生早。  
君生我未生，我生君已老。  
恨不生同時，日日與君好。  
我生君未生，君生我已老。  
我離君天涯，君隔我海角。  
我生君未生，君生我已老。  
化蝶去尋花，夜夜棲芳草。
