### Chart A - Violin Plot Analysis of What Time Orders are Made During Each Day of the Week

```{r Violin Plot Orders at Hour of the Day and Day of the Week}
instacart %>%
  group_by(order_dow, order_hour_of_day) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~order_dow, y = ~order_hour_of_day,

  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Day of the Week"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Hour of Day Order Made",zeroline = F))
```

### Chart B - Box Plot Analysis of Days Since Prior Order per Department

```{r Boxplot Days Since Prior Order and Department}
instacart %>%
  mutate(department = fct_reorder(department, days_since_prior_order)) %>%
  plot_ly(y = ~days_since_prior_order, color = ~department, type = "box", colors = "Set2") %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Department"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Days Since Prior Order",zeroline = F))
```

### Chart C - Bar Graph of Number of Items Ordered per Department

```{r}
## Bargraph Number of Items Ordered per Department
x <- list(title = "Department")
y <- list(title = "Amount of Items")
instacart %>%
  count(department) %>% 
  mutate(department = fct_reorder(department, n)) %>%
