### About this site

This website was made in accordance to Homework 4 Instructions as decreed by Professor Jeff Goldsmith through his p8105.com website.
R Studio Version 1.1.456, was used to build and knit the personal website. 
The site and its source code is hosted on Github 

Sometimes you need to say a bit about the site -- how it was made, where it's hosted, where the source code can be found. 

If this is for a project or analysis, I recommend giving some details about the R package versions that you used to create the content.
